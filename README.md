Yep, that's me, building yet another portfolio websites.

What's that? You want to know how many times I've rebuilt my site? I've lost count, but at least 4 times.

You're asking why? Simple really, I always feel like I can improve it. Especially since I usually learn a ton in between rebuilds.

My last site was made around 2 years ago, and at the time, I was pretty satisfied with it. Since then, I've learned so much and grown so much as a developer, that I recognized a lot of shortcomings in both it's design and implementation.

It was created when I had no real world job experience. It's purpose was to grab the users attention, and to showcase my abilities, to hopefully convince someone that I sorta knew what I was doing.

Now, I'm a lot more comfortable with my abilities, and feel more like I need to display relevant information to potential employers in a more digestable manner, rather than trying to impress anyone with shock and awe.

That doesn't mean I don't plan to polish this new portfolio, or that I won't put work into it. Just that I will take a more tasteful approach, where information about me is the showcase, while fancy animations and graphics are secondary.
